# cmdle
A word game for the command line.

Run `cmdle --help` to see a list of available commands.

## Building
I'm assuming you already have cargo and rust installed.

You'll need cargo-make. There are installation instructions here: `https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make#installation`

Once you've installed it, open cmd in the project directory and run `cargo make setup`. You should then be able to use all cargo commands normally.
